# Crosschain Transaction Monitor

A professional Web3 reference project that demonstrates how cross-chain token transfers and transaction states can be tracked and simulated across modern blockchain networks.

This repository is designed to teach clean architecture for monitoring transaction lifecycles, validating transfer status, and analyzing token movement between chains.

## Supported Networks

- Ethereum  
- Base  
- Polygon  
- Arbitrum  

---

## Project Goals

- Track transaction lifecycle across chains
- Simulate cross-chain token transfers
- Validate transfer confirmation states
- Monitor token movement analytics
- Teach professional Web3 monitoring architecture

## Architecture Overview

This project uses a simple root-only file structure. Each file is responsible for a single system role such as network handling, transaction tracking, validation, simulation, and analytics reporting.

---

## Features

- Multi-chain RPC connection
- Cross-chain transaction simulation
- Transfer state validation
- Analytics logging
- Beginner-friendly code design
